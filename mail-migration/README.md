# Mail migration

These scripts were developed to migrate all mail systems from subsidiaries companies to the matrix firm mail system. These subsidiaries were spreaded among several countries and several mail technologies were used (mostly linux).

User mailboxes were sent stored in physical support and from that support had to be imported in the matrix mail system.

This scripts are very specific to customer enviroment.

## Dependencies

These scripts were developed and tested under RHEL 5. x86_64 and they use the PersonalPerlLibrary module included in this repository as well.
