This script has been developed to automate whatever application you want to provide HA with TSAM.

To this script is able to work properly are needed some requirements:

* TSAM nodes installed and configured to be reachable by network and SSH.
* DNS resolution.
* Public key authentication between/among TSAM nodes with root users, including
  the node where the script is executed that must be able to login itself via
  ssh.
* Application must be installed in all TSAM nodes.
* Application must be able to start/stop/monitor in all TSAM nodes.
* Application scripts must be TSAM compliance (return codes).
* Application scripts/files paths must be the same across TSAM nodes.
* Application data must be on LVM volume groups inside a disk partition.
* Application filesystems must be unmouted in all TSAM nodes.
* Application filesystems must have its mount points in /etc/fstab including noauto option.
* Application must be stopped in all TSAM nodes.
* Network interfaces are configured in a symmetric way across the nodes.

This script has been designed to be application independent and may not fit your needs.
