This repository contains scripts that I developed to perform some tasks when I worked as a VMware consultant. I will be adding more when I locate them aamong my personal backups. Due to I am not working as a VMware consultant I am afraid that it will take me time to locate them.

# rdm directory

This directory contains power shell scripts to get RDM disks from a virtual machine and to set the policy to fixed to the RDM disks.

These scripts were developed for ESXi versions 4.0 and 4.1.

# vcb directory

This directory contains a bash script used to restore a vm from a VCB backup. It was developed for ESX versions 3.0 and 3.5.

# perl-sdk directory

This directory contains a modified version of a script distributed with the vmware perl sdk to create a virtual machine with two network interfaces.

# vmware-api directory

This directory contains a python script to document callable objects inside a python module. This module was written to documment an undocumented and unsupported vSphere python API included in VMware ESXi.
